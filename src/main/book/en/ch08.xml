	<title>Advantages of using Jenkins TestLink Plug-in</title>
	
	<para>The plug-in is not intended to be a test automation solution, though 
	it helps you to automate your tests. It is not intended to manage your 
	automated tests either, as this can be done in TestLink. The purpose of 
	the plug-in is integrate Jenkins, a continuous integration server, 
	and TestLink, a test management tool.</para>
	
	<para>There are three clear advantages in using this approach. First, 
	if you are already using Jenkins as continuous integration server and 
	TestLink as test management tool, then you won't have another tool to worry 
	about. Simply install the plug-in and then DevOps will keep working in 
	Jenkins, testers will keep working in TestLink and your boss will be more 
	than happy to know that he won't need to buy another tool and training for 
	an automated tests management tool.</para>
	
	<para>Secondly, it is language independent. You can run tests in PHP, Perl, 
	Python, Java, Lua and even in C or C++. The only limitation here is that 
	you have to output your test results either in JUnit, TestNG or TAP.</para>
	
	<para>And lastly, it is free. The team of the plug-in are contributors of 
	TestLink, maintainers of the TestLink Java API, and keep trying to fix 
	the issues in <ulink url="http://issues.jenkins-ci.org">Jenkins' JIRA</ulink> 
	as fast as they can. So if you use the plug-in, send us your feedback, 
	write in the plug-in Wiki about your case or buy us a beer.</para>
